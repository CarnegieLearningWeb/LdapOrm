    # The entity manager is instantiated as a service and one of its arguments are the
    # configured parameters. While it and subclasses will have these parameters supplied
    # in applications which use this bundle, loading the the base service in the container
    # will complain if it has no configuration. The following parameters resolve the
    # entity managers need for these parameters. It's just fluff that will be ignored.
